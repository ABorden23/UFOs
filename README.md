## Purpose:

* Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
* Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
* Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
* Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
* Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.

Overview of the analysis:

A client names Dana would like us to provide an in-dephth analysis of UFO sightings using a filter search. 

Using JavaScript we have created an HTML webpage using bootstrap/css compenents to modify the appearance of the website.

## Results

Search Filter in Use:

While utilizing the search filter you can search by date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO sightings. 

For example we used fl for the "city" and us for the "country" and found the UFO sightings for those credentials.

## Summary:

* Drawback - Without previous knowledge of UFO sightings the user must know exactly what search criteria they are seeking by siphting through the data before typing in the info they are looking for. 

While using this search criteria a recommendation to increase usability of the filter search would be to add a grammar corrector because the search is case sensitive and does not pick up all data unless typed correctly.

Adding a date range to the filters could help the user further dial in on the data the user is seeking out.
